In Power BI, you can achieve your goal of connecting three data sources with similar columns but different names, adding new columns, and then appending them into a single column as follows:

Connect Data Sources:

Connect your three data sources (swc, swci, swci id) to Power BI.
Transform Data:

For each data source, perform the necessary data transformations to add columns bbs, arp, and bbs2. The values for these columns should be the same as their column names. You can do this using the Power Query Editor in Power BI.
For example, you can use the "Add Custom Column" feature in Power Query and use a formula like this:

M
Copy code
Table.AddColumn(Source, "bbs", each [bbs])
Table.AddColumn(Source, "arp", each [arp])
Table.AddColumn(Source, "bbs2", each [bbs2])
Combine Data Sources:

Once you have added the required columns in each of your data sources, you can combine them into a single table. To do this, you can use the "Append Queries" feature in Power Query. Here's how:
a. Go to the Power Query Editor.
b. Select the first data source (e.g., swc).
c. Go to the "Home" tab and click on "Append Queries."
d. Choose the second data source (e.g., swci) and repeat this for the third data source (e.g., swci id).
e. This will combine the data from all three data sources into a single table.

Create a New Column (SWC1):

After combining the data sources, you can create a new column called SWC1 to consolidate the data. You can use the "Add Custom Column" feature to do this:
M
Copy code
Table.AddColumn(CombinedTable, "SWC1", each [swc] & [swci] & [swci id])
Load Data:

Once you've added the SWC1 column, click the "Close & Apply" button to load the data into Power BI.
Now, you should have a single table in Power BI with the combined data from your three data sources, and a new column SWC1 containing the concatenated values of swc, swci, and swci id.
