Problem Statement:
Design and develop an automated system that streamlines the process of sending emails to individuals based on the data present in a specific column of an Excel file. The system should allow users to open an Excel file, scan its contents, and identify rows with draft values in a designated column. For each identified row, the system should generate and send an appropriate email to the corresponding person, based on the values present in other columns. The emails to be sent can fall into three distinct types, each requiring specific content and formatting. The goal of the system is to enhance efficiency and reduce manual effort in the email communication process while ensuring accurate and personalized messaging based on the Excel data.
