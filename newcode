1. Strengths, Contributions, and Impact
This year, I completed two important projects that show my hard work and commitment.

Accelerated Report Card Project: I finished this project early, meeting all the requirements and making sure everything worked well. Finishing ahead of time gave us more room for testing and making small improvements, which helped make the project a success. This showed that I can manage projects with many steps and stay on schedule.

BCA ACH Bot Project: This was a complex project using an Automation Anywhere bot, which was like doing several projects in one. I had to keep updating the bot’s code due to frequent changes, but I stayed on top of each change to make sure we could start testing on time. This project really showed my persistence and ability to handle big, challenging tasks that make work easier for the team.

These projects highlight my strengths in staying organized, meeting deadlines, and delivering good results on difficult projects.

2. Areas to Improve and What I Learned
Looking back, I see a few areas where I can get even better:

Dealing with Frequent Changes: While I handled the changes on the BCA ACH Bot project, it sometimes slowed down the work. I want to improve my ability to adjust quickly when changes come up, making it easier to keep things moving.

Managing Time on Big Projects: Both projects needed a lot of focus, especially with all the changes in the BCA ACH Bot project. I plan to improve my time management so I can balance tasks better and stay on track, even when projects are demanding.

Getting Feedback More Often: On big projects, it can be challenging to get quick feedback. I aim to have more regular check-ins with my team to make sure we’re always on the same page and working smoothly together.

These are good lessons for me, and I’ll keep working on adapting, managing time, and teamwork.

3. Behavior and Working with Others
Throughout the year, I’ve worked to be a good team player and keep things positive.

Dependable and Calm: On both projects, I stayed calm and focused, even when there were challenges. My team could count on me to keep things moving and handle problems as they came up.

Good Communication: I always kept communication open and respectful, which helped create a positive and collaborative atmosphere. I think this made it easier for everyone to share ideas and give feedback.

Proactive and Helpful: I tried to spot issues early and suggest solutions. My teammates and managers appreciated my efforts to step up and take on challenges when needed.

Overall, I believe my approach helped us work well together and kept our projects moving forward in a positive way.
