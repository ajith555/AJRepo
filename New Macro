pureName 
pureName takes a security name (secName) as a parameter and processes it to extract a cleaner or "pure"data
Checks for "WTS" in secName:
If the position of "WTS" is greater than 2, the part before "WTS" and after it (excluding "WTS") is retained.
If "WTS" is at position 2 or earlier, the part after "WTS" (excluding "WTS") is retained.
Similar actions as above is done on RIS, OTH, UNTS, SCROW etc
and at last returns the processed secName as the result of the function


nameGames
it searches for a matching name based on certain criteria in a workbook named "NAMES.xls
it takes a secName (security name) as input
If the ASCII value is less than 65 (A), it sets it to 65. If it's greater than 90 (Z), it sets it to 90
Sets the DEPT variable to "BUYINS
Initializes variables for the search process: searchRow, nameMatch, startRange, and endRange
Initializes loop until a match name is found
Checks if the cell in the workbook "NAMES.xls" in the specified row and column 3 (or 4) is not empty. If not, it sets startRange (or endRange) to the ASCII value of the character
If the cell in column 2 matches the DEPT and the ASCII value of the letter falls within the range defined by startRange and endRange, it sets nameGames to the value in column 1 of the matching row, and nameMatch is set to True
If no match is found in the loop, it checks if the next row has an empty value in column 1. If so, it sets nameGames to "NO MATCH FOUND," and nameMatch is set to True
function returns the found name or NO MATCH FOUND

getToThePoint 
It extracts the last word from a given comment


prevDate
It calculates the previous date based on the input date (thisDay)
function takes a date (thisDay) as input
Declares two variables: tempDay (to store the formatted previous date) and prevDay (to store the calculated previous date)
Calculates the previous day by subtracting 1 from the input date: prevDay = thisDay - 1
Checks if the month of the previous day is less than 10. If so, it adds a leading zero to the month
Checks if the day of the previous day is less than 10. If so, it adds a leading zero to the day
Formats the year to include only the last two digits
Concatenates the formatted month, day, and year into the tempDay variable
Returns the formatted previous date stored in tempDay

posteros 
it analyzes data in a worksheet named "All Fails" in a workbook specified by the variable prevZero. It seems to count occurrences of different conditions and then update another workbook named "FAIL REPORTING2" with the results


otherReports 
it calls subroutines (verlThreshold, cnsShorts, createNSreport, and reStrictedRepor)

doItAll
It calls subroutines: merge and otherReports

pullUnique
It processes data in a worksheet starting from row 3. It sets the number format of column 25 to text (@). It searches for the string "UNIQUE #:" in column 24 and extracts the 12 characters following it to column 25. If the length of the content in column 24 is 12, it checks if it's numeric. If so, it prepends an "I" to the content in column 25; otherwise, it copies the content from column 24 to column 25.

isAffiliate
function takes a parameter bkr (a broker code) and returns True if it matches either "0642" or "0652", indicating that it's an affiliate. Otherwise, it returns False

in642Range
takes a parameter firstChar (the first character of something) and returns True if it is "6". Otherwise, it returns False

oldEnough
It takes a parameter unique ( a unique identifier) and returns True if the conditions specified are met. It checks whether the leftmost two characters of the identifier are "13", and if the numeric value represented by characters 3 to 6 is greater than or equal to 711. Alternatively, if the numeric value of the leftmost two characters is greater than 13, it returns True. Otherwise, it returns False

newRegSho
It changes the directory name specifying semicolon and datatype
