Process each line, determining whether to call carriageScan or pipeScan based on the presence of carriage return characters.
Add data to it.
Perform text-to-columns operation.
Sort the data.
Save the workbook with a specific file name.

pipeScan
pipeScan function takes two string parameters, threshHold and sourceData. It scans the threshHold string, which is expected to contain data separated by pipe (|) characters. The function processes the data and outputs a formatted string

carriageScan
designed to process and scan a text string (threshHold) that contains carriage return characters (line breaks, represented by Chr(10)

addBlanks
function generates a string of blank spaces based on the specified number of spaces (needSpaces). It uses a loop to concatenate a space character (Chr(32)) to the temp string for the specified number of times, and the resulting string is then returned. it creates a string consisting of a certain number of  spaces

restrictedReport
The code reads the trade date from the text file at position 15 for a length of 8 characters.
It uses this information to set the tradeDate variable.
It checks if the 13th column of the current row contains a valid date (IsDate(Cells(currentRow, 13))).
If true, it sets the settleDate variable to the date in column 13.
It then calculates a new date, buyInDate, which is tradeDate + 35
If the trade date is greater than the settle date and a specific condition is met (tradeDate > settleDate and a cell in the 15th column is empty), it updates the 15th column with the text "AS OF TRADE"
The code formats dates for creating directories and naming files.
It uses the formatted date information to create directory paths and filenames
