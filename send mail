.SYNOPSIS
Send emails from Outlook client using PowerShell with personalized HTML body from a shared mailbox, to multiple recipients listed in a CSV file.

.DESCRIPTION
This PowerShell script sends emails from the Outlook client installed on the desktop. It reads recipient details from a CSV file, and sends individual emails to each recipient with a personalized HTML body that includes their name. The emails are sent from a shared mailbox.

.NOTES
- The script requires Outlook client to be installed on the desktop and connected to a valid Exchange account with appropriate permissions to send emails from the shared mailbox.
- The CSV file should contain the following columns: Recipient, Subject, FirstName. Replace the sample CSV file name and column names in the script with your actual values before running it.
- Replace the sample HTML body string in the script with your actual HTML body, and use the placeholder `{0}` to represent the recipient's name, which will be replaced with the actual recipient's first name.

.EXAMPLE
Send-EmailsFromOutlook -CSVFilePath "C:\Recipients.csv" -SharedMailboxName "shared.mailbox@example.com"
