To ensure that the updating of the "Last Affirmed Date" and "Review Date" columns only occurs when users select "Affirm" from a different column, you can modify the steps as follows:

Open your SharePoint Online site and navigate to the list or library where you have the columns set up.

Create a new choice column called "Affirmation Status" (or any suitable name) and specify the available choices, including "Affirm."

Create a new calculated column called "Last Affirmed Date Calculated" with the following formula:

less
Copy code
=IF([Affirmation Status]="Affirm",TODAY(),"")
This formula checks if the "Affirmation Status" column is set to "Affirm." If it is, it updates the column with the current date using the TODAY() function.

Create another calculated column called "Review Date Calculated" with the following formula:
sql
Copy code
=IF(ISBLANK([Last Affirmed Date Calculated]),"",DATE(YEAR([Last Affirmed Date Calculated]),MONTH([Last Affirmed Date Calculated])+3,DAY([Last Affirmed Date Calculated])))
This formula is the same as before, calculating the review date by adding 3 months to the "Last Affirmed Date Calculated."

Save the calculated columns.

Create a SharePoint workflow using SharePoint Designer or Power Automate.

Set the trigger for the workflow to be triggered when an item is modified in the list or library.

Add a condition to the workflow to check if the "Affirmation Status" column is set to "Affirm."

If the condition is met, update the "Last Affirmed Date" column with the current date.

Add another action to calculate the review date by adding 3 months to the "Last Affirmed Date."

Update the "Review Date" column with the calculated review date.

Save and publish the workflow.

Now, the "Last Affirmed Date" and "Review Date" columns will only be updated when users select "Affirm" from the "Affirmation Status" column.
