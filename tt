Dear Team,

I hope this email finds you well. I would like to bring to your attention the current state of my Surface desktop, which was provided to me during my tenure in Pune. Unfortunately, it has not been updated, and I am experiencing issues with its charger.

Since transitioning to the team in Hyderabad last year, I kindly request assistance from someone on the team to either replace the charger and update the Surface or provide me with a replacement device altogether.

I appreciate your prompt attention to this matter.

Thank you and best regards,
